Sagar B Dollin

This [Quantum Simulator](https://github.com/SagarDollin/QuantumComputerSimulator) is an updated version of the previouys simulator that I built.
It has:
  1. Rotation Gates like Rx, Ry, and R
  2. It is has trnasformations that are differentiabnle like Rx, Ry, R .
  3. It uses GPU capabilities to compute Linear Transformations and expected Values
  4. It is learanble and can be subjected for QML
  
  Please go through the additional files added along with MyQuantumSimulator.py to get more insights about the updates.

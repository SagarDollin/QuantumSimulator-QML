# QuantumSimulator-QML
Sagar B Dollin

This is an updated version of the [Quantum Simulator](https://github.com/SagarDollin/QuantumComputerSimulator) previously built.
It has:
  1. Rotation Gates like Rx, Ry, and R
  2. It has differentiable transformations, like Rx, Ry, and R.
  3. It uses GPU capabilities to compute Linear Transformations and expected Values
  4. It is learnable and can be subjected to QML
  
  Please take a look at the additional files added along with MyQuantumSimulator.py to get more insights about the updates.
